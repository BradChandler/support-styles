# Support Styles

This repository is used for tracking and sharing foundational styling for several different applications.\
Copy and paste this over to any new project to get a head start on styling. 

## _style.scss
This file contains the reset styles that I use across apps to override user agent defaults with my own preferences.

## _mixins.scss
This file contains common mixins that I use across several applications to reduce time spent typing in related css rules.

## _variables.scss
This file contains several common variables used across applications and some colors that can be easily replaced with app-level colors.

## _helpers.scss
This file contains several helper classes that can be placed on elements. This should reduce the amount of styling written and make common styles very easy to add to a given element.

## _buttons.scss
This file contains base level styling for buttons. Just add colors and then treat these classes like the helpers.

## _layout.scss
This file contains all styling for the container class to produce consistent gutter and content width.
